# Remark On Tableau forecasting method
The forecast of Tableau is too simple, which seems like to be some simple naive method and cannot be replied since the forecast line does not capture the curve part. Therefore, decent forecast method like decomposition, autoregression, etc should be implemented for a better performance in forecasting.
